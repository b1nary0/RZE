=====

A personal project so I can have something to work on and experiment with during my off time.
I don't have a strict schedule with this project, so you may see some bursts of commits and then some downtime, but I am always thinking of what is next and where I want to go with it.

That being said there is certainly a lot of temp code that is subject to refactoring in the future, and I have a Clubhouse.io project set up to keep track of my tasks.

THAT being said, if you see anything that could use some advice or suggestions, please e-mail me @ covedrop@gmail.com
