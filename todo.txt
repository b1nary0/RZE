[ TODO ] 

@ Create engine class to drive initial setup
@ Create basic window
@ write basic message pump for window
@ set up include dirs to avoid "../" usage
@ probably set up a pch or some similar structure while its still easy to integrate



! event system to properly pass events from window message pump to rest of engine

* better understand message pump -- can avoid while (getmessage) are there ever multiple messages to resolve per frame?

* hook up better functionality to window message pump
	@ screen can't be moved properly, what is causing this? ( ended up being improperly handled WM_ACTIVATE )

* think about multi-threading
		
* update loop is weird... app updates, then app updates engine? weird.
		
* verify proper additional include directory setup
	
* Customize window creation (borderless, fullscren, etc) easily configurable

* Set up gcc to do cross-compiler testing
